              Failure to report and manage sexual harassment harming African
              news media
            </h1>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
              African media has a sexual harassment problem. But many cases of
              physical and verbal sexual harassment go unreported because of
              fear of further victimisation and a lack of confidence in
              management systems and interventions. When action is taken,
              results are often underwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
              WIN’s latest research, the first phase of a multi-region study,
              set out to collect credible information about the scale of
              harassment in news outlets in Africa and to establish what was
              being done to provide safer newsrooms.

              About 584 survey respondents, from eight countries, namely Kenya,
              Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda,
              responded to questions on sexual harassment at work - verbal
              and/or physical. It found:
            </p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
              <li>
                About 47% of women had been sexually harassed at work, while 43%
                of gender non conforming individuals and 19.5% of men said they
                had faced unwanted sexual attention.
              </li>
              <li>
                When broken down into verbal and physical sexual harassment, 56%
                of women said they had been on the receiving end of verbal
                harassment, while 38% reported physical sexual harassment. For
                gender non-conforming people, 50% had been verbally harassed,
                and 36%&nbsp; had faced physical harassment. Some 24% of male
                respondents experienced verbal sexual harassment and 15%
                physical sexual harassment.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Almost half, 46.12%, had witnessed at least one incident of
                sexual harassment with 16.5% stating they had seen five or more
                incidents.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>Only 30% of cases were reported.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>
                Once reported, formal action was only taken by the media
                organisation 42% of the time.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h2 class="center-align">Low Reporting</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Fear</strong> prevented many from filing formal
              complaints. These were the common concerns:&nbsp;
            </p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
              <li>I was afraid of losing my job;&nbsp;</li>
              <li>I was afraid it would negatively impact my job;&nbsp;</li>
              <li>I was afraid of retaliation;&nbsp;</li>
              <li>
                I did not want myself or others to be negatively labelled.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The <strong>absence of and lack of awareness of </strong
              ><strong>reporting mechanisms</strong> also explained
              inaction.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost half, 46.7%, of those surveyed said their organisation had
              no sexual harassment policy, 35.9% were unaware of what was in the
              policy and just 17.4% were aware of its contents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of the 32 managers interviewed 68.7% said their organisation had a
              sexual harassment policy - 46.7% had been trained on it.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps the biggest impedance in reporting is that the
              <strong>perpetrators are often managers</strong> or supervisors -
              people with responsibility and power. Survey respondents
              identified their harassers as fellow employees (in 38% of cases)
              but 21,5% of the time they were direct supervisors and in 19.5% of
              cases, members of higher management.
            </p>
            <p>
              When action was taken in 42% of cases reported, the most common
              organisational responses were to warn the perpetrator (42%), offer
              emotional support for the participant (12.7%), dismiss the case
              after review (12.5%), and provide training for staff about sexual
              harassment (9%)

              see value in calling it out, and so the cycle will perpetuate.”
              There are solutions, however, beginning with owners and managers
              acknowledging the problem exists and then committing to ensuring a
              safer working space, not just for women, but for all staff. It is
              vitally important to change the culture of silence around
              harassment. And this culture change can only come from the very
              top.”

                Almost half the managers,46%, said they felt the industry no

                Yet more than half of those interviewed, 53%, had themselves
                been the target of harassment. This figure is in line with the
                overall prevalence found in the survey.
              </li>
              <li>
                Less than 10% of managers had reported the issue - this is much

              is no simple explanation for this - but what is common is that
              both staff and managers have had first-hand experience of sexual
              harassment, and in most cases chose not to report it. This
              suggests fear of victimisation runs alongside a lack of confidence

              organisations that have begun to actively manage the problem -

            <h2 class="center-align">CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>This research has provided evidence of the need for media organisations to recognise the extent of sexual harassment and put in plans steps to provide a safer working environment.</p>
            <blockquote>
                “It all starts with a conversation on what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour in your media organisation. - being explicit about sexual harassment - sharing definitions, what behaviours are unacceptable, and communicating the right for every employee to be treated equally. It is not enough to have a policy; staff and managers must be trained on what the procedures are for making and managing a complaint. Everyone should be clear about the consequences of sexual harassment. It is far better to be proactive and prepared than pushed into a crisis management position when a case emerges,”
